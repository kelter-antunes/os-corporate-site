                        OutSystems Platform was built from the ground up to ensure fast and secure change during the whole life cycle of your applications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can make deep changes to your applications&#39; data model, APIs and architecture, knowing that all dependencies will be automatically updated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        No matter how much you modify your applications, OutSystems Platform acts as a co-pilot and gatekeeper to guarantee zero-error deployment.

                                Change applications faster, decrease maintenance costs, and ensure that&nbsp;no matter how big the change, your applications will always be architecturally sound and functional. OutSystems Platform tracks global dependencies and pinpoints the impact of a change across all layers of your application. It heals the sections that can be automatically corrected and tells you about the required manual corrections. It also automates the deployment process including all database change scripts and the impact this change will have in the running application.

                                Built-in application monitoring, along with our&nbsp;visual debugger, allow you to easily pinpoint the part of the application that needs to be corrected. The impact analysis engine will ensure that all of your changes are sound, and the automated deployment process will assist you in releasing&nbsp;your hotfixes. This allows you to react as soon as a problem is found, which dramatically compresses your corrective maintenance cycles.

                                By using visual models, OutSystems Platform makes it easy to understand the architecture of each application. Easier knowledge transfer reduces the risk of switching development teams and contractors&nbsp;and eliminates the issue of orphan code. Onboarding new developers is simplified, giving you more flexibility in allocating resources to projects.
